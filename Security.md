# Safety Tips

As the coins are in the user's custody, the following measures are of utmost importance to ensure the safety of your funds. You are not required to take these steps, but as the responsibility for your funds is yours, we encourage you to do so.

### Wallet Encryption

Wallet encryption consists of adding a layer of security by entering a password whenever you move funds or other actions that directly or indirectly affect your funds.

#### To do:
- Go to menu ```Settings``` ```>``` ```Encrypt Wallet```
- Create your password. It is recommended that this be a strong password.
- Save your password in a safe place that only you or trusted people have access to.

Heads up:
If you forget/lose your password you will no longer be able to move your coins and may lose your funds forever.
Be careful when saving the password on digital media. The intent of encrypting your wallet is to prevent someone or malicious software from being able to move your funds if they have access to your computer. If you leave your password exposed, it's no use.

### Wallet backup

Wallet backup ensures that if your computer crashes and you lose your files, you can have a copy of your wallet that gives you access to your coins.

#### To do:
- Go to menu ```File``` ```>``` ```backup wallet (backup wallet)```
- A window will appear for you to choose where to save the wallet file. Save it to one or more secure locations. You can make copies of this file on USB sticks for example.
- Backing up once is usually enough, but to avoid address de-indexing problems it is recommended to redo the backup every time you generate a new receiving address or create a new masternode.

Extra backup tip: You can also back up by copying the entire currency data folder to a safe location. It is usually located:
- On linux: ```/home/username/.currencyname/``` (folder is normally hidden. Use ```Ctrl+H``` shortcut to view hidden items)
- On windows: ```%appdata%/currencyname/```


Heads up:
If you have not done the wallet encryption procedure before backing up, this wallet file is unprotected and anyone with access to this file can move your funds, so be careful.
